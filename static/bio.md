## About me:

My name is Tom (Or Tomás) Rinaldi.

I'm a full stack developer, having worked on applications using different languages
like **JavaScript** and **C#**, using technologies like **Express.js**, **React**,
**Svelte** *(This page was made with **SvelteKit**)*, **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.

### The Pixel

When I was in school, I wanted to create videogames and enter the industry. In 2016
my first complete game was **The Pixel**, a simple mobile arcade game where pixels
start to attack you and you have to use touch controls to destroy them.

It's my first completed game I made, with a full gameplay loop, a local high score
system and a customizable pixel.

The code was kinda rough on the edges, and probably it had a lot of spaghettification,
so I decided to learn how to make a game from some other place rather than YouTube
tutorials.

### Catneep

A rhythm game that plays like guitar hero but with visual effects distracting the
players due to the band members consuming catneep. This was my first game I made
with a team.

It wasn't a complete game but it was a good start. And it involved ensuring the
visuals match the music as it is important in a rhythm game.

### Simius Labs

I started studying a **videogame development degree** at the **Mendoza University**
and along with some classmates we formed **Simius Labs**, to start making games.
We made a 2D platformer on mobile called **Hammerdwarf**, where we control a dwarf
who can't jump but uses his hammer to go though the level using different mechanics.

After that we remade **The Pixel** into a new 3D game for android, with
visual effects and some new mechanics.

Currently a new improved version is being develop, with better codebase
and improved graphics using the new Unity Technologies.

### Mimic Games

During my studies, I worked at Mimic Games, learning how to program in a team, how to
use git and many programming patterns.

I worked on a multi-platform app to track a baseball game score, using **C#** and
**Unity** with heavy use of the MVC pattern. I also made some other casual games and
tested new game concepts with the team each day of the week.

### Urban Explorers

Later, I joined with some classmates and friends to start a game about urban exploration,
with the mechanics focusing on the lighting as a resource.

I started leading the programming team and using some TDD programming to ensure
functionality. Some stuff I made was:

* Inventory system
* Command console
* Postprocessing effects
